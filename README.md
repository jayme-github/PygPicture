PygPicture
==========

(very) simple coverflow game launcher to be used with gamepads.

I was sick of searching the mouse to select the game I wanted to play. BIG PICTURE was no option since I don't like/want the overhead (Steam) on my box.
So I started searching and ended up writing my own little tool ... PygPicture!
